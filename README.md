FEND: Home town project

The starting point on this project is the point where I finished lesson 2 of Responsive Web Design Fundamentals.

Resources and threads that I found helpful at various points (although I've looked at lots of stuff and I'm pretty sure that there are lots of contradictions):

I really wanted to do all media queries using min-width. But this is getting very frustrating. I will relent and use max-width for the smallest viewport. - perhaps all will become clear in a new course.

So main.css will effectively be "not really the smallest" and small-ish.css will be the smallest.
